# counter_riverpod

This small challenge shows how to implement the Flutter Counter App with Riverpod State Management.
For simplicity we work only in the main.dart file.

## Getting Started
1. Create a new Flutter Project or check out the main branch to get the starting code.
2. Look at the code and make sure you can launch the app on a smartphone or simulator.
3. Add the flutter_riverpod dependency to the project and wrap your App with a ProviderScope Widget.
4. Create a new Provider which holds an integer, starting with 0.
5. Consume the provided integer and show it's current state.
6. When the user clicks on the FloatingActionButton increment it's state by one.
